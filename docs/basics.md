Time to test out formulas!

* Number of matches played: `n - 1`
* Number of rounds of play: `log2(n)`

| Category              |      Value                |   Example / Notes |
| -------------         | :-----------:             | -----: |
| # of Matches Played   | `N - 1`                   | 16 competitors = 15 matches played <br />17 competitors = 16 matches played |
| # of Rounds Played    |   `logâ‚‚(N)`               | 16 competitors = 4 rounds played <br /> 17 competitors = 5 rounds played |
| Distinct Placements   |   1st & 2nd, 3rd* & 4th, 4x T-5th,<br />8x T-9th, 16x T-17th, etc.       |   |
| Possible progressions | 1, 2, 3*, 4, 8, 16, etc.   | 

**Only when a third place match is played.*
