These are some basic concepts I'll be referencing throughout my format guides.

## Stages / Phases and Progressions / Advancements

Many competitions consist of more than just one bracket or bracket type.
For example, a competition might *start* with round-robin and then *end* with a single-elim bracket.
I refer to these as the 'stages' of a tournament, and you'll also see these referred to as 'phases' on tools like smash.gg.

Moving from one stage to another stage is what I call *advancing* or *progressing*.
We see both of these concepts all the time in traditional sports.
A team "making the playoffs" means that they advance from one stage (regular season play) to another stage (the playoffs bracket).

## Groups / Pools

As the number of competitors scales up, competitions are usually broken up (either functionally or visually) into groups.
You can imagine, for example, that a double-elimination bracket of 512 competitors would be a behemoth to look at!
For easier digestion and logistics, that 512 competitor bracket can instead be visually represented as groups (also known as 'pools') feeding into a final bracket.

Let's say we draw it up as 16 groups/pools of 32 competitors each (16 groups \* 32 per group = 512), where the top two competitors per group advance to a 'final' bracket (16 groups * 2 advancing per group = 32 competitors in the final bracket).
The exact number of groups, and how many advance, etc., are all subjective.

For other formats, like round-robin, the act of dividing competitors into separate groups is actually a functional change to how many matches are played, and what those matches are.
Breaking into groups, in those cases, is done for purposes of runtime/logistics and for story/structure.

## Seeding

Seeding has multiple meanings.

* Seeding, as a *noun*, is the starting positions of competitors in a competition.
 In a bracket, this is a particular 'slot' in the bracket.
 In round-robin groups, this would be which group you are placed into.
 In Swiss, this would be your pairing number.
* Seeding, as a *verb*, is the act of sorting competitors from highest skill to lowest skill.
 Once this sorting has been performed, that seeding is 'applied' to place competitors into their starting positions.

Seeding plays an important role because it determines the path a competitor must take.
'Accurate' seeding means that competitors are correctly sorted from highest skill to lowest skill, and should result in a fair competition.
'Bad' seeding would mean that competitors are not sorted correctly, and can lead to painful situations.
These adjectives are subjective, but usually have elements of objective basis to them.

In each format, I will touch on how the format interacts with seeding as a consideration.
Some formats are heavily reliant on accurate seeding.
Some formats are well-suited to determine accurate seeding for another stage.
