These are some basic format concepts which I'll be referencing throughout my format guides.

## Stages / Phases and Progressions / Advancements

Many competitions consist of more than just one bracket or bracket type.
For example, a competition might *start* with round-robin and then *end* with a single-elim bracket.
I refer to these as the 'stages' of a tournament, and you'll also see these referred to as 'phases' on certain bracketing software.

Moving from one stage to another stage is what I call 'advancing' or 'progressing'.
We see both of these concepts all the time in traditional sports.
A team "making the playoffs" means that they advance from one stage (regular season play) to another stage (the playoffs bracket).

## Groups / Pools

As the number of competitors scales up, competitions are usually broken up—either functionally or visually—into groups.
You can imagine, for example, that a double-elimination bracket of 512 competitors would be a behemoth to look at!
For easier digestion and logistics, that 512 competitor bracket can instead be visually represented as groups (also known as 'pools') feeding into a final bracket.

Let's say we take that 512-team bracket, and instead draw it up as 16 groups/pools of 32 competitors each (16 groups \* 32 per group = 512), where the top two competitors per group advance to a 'final' bracket (16 groups * 2 advancing per group = 32 competitors in the final bracket).

The exact number of groups, and how many advance, is subjective.
The point is that competitors, Competitive Ops, and Broadcast will be able to easily digest whichever *piece* of the overall puzzle they're currently focused on.

For other formats, like round-robin, the act of dividing competitors into separate groups is more than just an aesthetic difference;
it changes how many matches are played, and what those matches are.
Using groups, in those cases, is done to change runtime/scheduling and the story/structure.

## Seeding

Seeding has multiple meanings.

* Seeding, as a *noun*, is the starting positions of competitors in a competition.
 It can universally be represented as a numbered list going from Seed 1 to Seed *n* (for *n* competitors).
 A competitor's 'seed' is their position on this list (1st seed, 5th seed, 17th seed, etc.).
  * In a bracket, a competitor's seed determines which 'slot' of the bracket they start in.
  * In round-robin groups, a competitor's seed determines which group they are placed into.
  * In Swiss, a seed is the competitor's pairing number.
* Seeding, as a *verb*, is the act of sorting competitors from highest skill to lowest skill.
 Once this sorting has been performed, that seeding is then 'applied' to place competitors into their starting positions.

Seeding plays an important role because it determines the path a competitor must take.
'Accurate' seeding means that competitors are correctly sorted from highest skill to lowest skill, and should result in a fair competition.
'Bad' seeding would mean that competitors are not sorted correctly, and can lead to painful situations.
These adjectives are subjective, but usually have elements of objective basis to them.

In each format guide, I will touch on how that format interacts with seeding.
Some formats are heavily reliant on accurate seeding,
 while some formats are not.
Some formats are actually well-suited to *determine* accurate seeding for another stage.

## Bracketing Software/Tournament Tools

Unless you're doing things by hand (or in a private spreadsheet), you'll probably be making use of some form of bracketing software.
Popular choices include:

* [smash.gg](https://smash.gg)
* [Battlefy](https://battlefy.com)
* [Challonge](https://challonge.com)
* [Toornament](https://toornament.com)

They each boast their own strengths and weaknesses, and support different formats in different ways.
This is obviously not an exhaustive list of tools, and certain games communities have built their own software for their particular needs.
But in general, these tools will offer invaluable features such as:

* A webpage for your tournament's info
* A way for competitors to register for your competition
* A means of seeding
* A means of generating brackets
  * For certain formats & event sizes, this is imperative because doing so by hand would be a monstrous undertaking
* A means of entering results & automatically progressing competitors to their next matches or stage
* A way for anyone to look at the brackets and follow along
