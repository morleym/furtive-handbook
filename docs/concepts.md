These are some basic format concepts which I'll be referencing throughout my format guides.

## Stages / Phases and Progressions / Advancements

:::important

Need a visual to show an example of a multi-stage format. Like a flowchart. One box for 'league play', an arrow pointing to the next box of 'playoffs', and maybe info in each like "16 competitors" and "round-robin" in league play box, "top 8 advance" on the arrow, and then "8 competitors" and "single-elimination" in playoffs box

:::

Many competitions consist of more than just one bracket or bracket type.
For example, a competition might *start* with round-robin and then *end* with a single-elim bracket.
I refer to these as the 'stages' of a tournament, and you'll also see these referred to as 'phases' on certain bracketing software.

Moving competitors from one stage to the next is what I call 'advancing' or 'progressing'.
We see both of these concepts all the time in traditional sports:
 a team "making the playoffs" means that they advanced from one stage (regular season play) to another stage (the playoffs bracket).

## Groups / Pools

As the number of competitors scales up, competitions are usually broken up—visually and/or functionally—into groups.
Imagine trying to read a gigantic double-elimination bracket of 512 competitors.
And, if it's an in-person events where the number of setups is limited, then how would you schedule out who is going to play their matches where & when?

![big bracket no, format yes](/img/format-guides/concepts-GroupsPools.png)

For easier digestion and logistics, that 512 competitor bracket can *instead* be divided into several, digestable groups (also known as 'pools') which feed into a final bracket.
Here's how that works: Let's say we take that 512-team bracket and draw it up as 16 groups/pools of 32 competitors each (16 groups \* 32 per group = 512), where the top two competitors per group advance to a 'final' bracket (16 groups \* 2 advancing per group = 32 competitors in the final bracket).
You could then schedule these 16 groups into different timeslots, assign different staff to run each of them, and focus on the storyline within each individual group when you broadcast matches ("who's going to advance out of *this* group?").

The exact number of groups, and how many advance per group, is subjective.
The ultimate goal is that Competitors, Competitive Ops, and Broadcast can all easily manage and understand whichever *piece* of the overall puzzle they're currently focused on.

For some formats, like round-robin, the act of dividing competitors into separate groups will actually change *how many* matches are played, and *what* those matches are.
Using groups, in those cases, is done to adjust runtime/scheduling and the story/structure.

:::note

Using groups for *single-elimination* doesn't change any matchups. Using groups for *double-elimination* will change the losers-side matchups.

## Seeding

:::important

Need visuals what a seeding list looks like, and what it looks like to take an unordered list of competitors and sort them into a seeding list

:::

Seeding has multiple meanings.

* Seeding, as a *noun*, is the starting positions of competitors in a competition.
 It can universally be represented as a numbered list going from Seed 1 to Seed *n* (for *n* competitors).
 A competitor's 'seed' is their position on this list (1st seed, 5th seed, 17th seed, etc.).
  * In a bracket, a competitor's seed determines which 'slot' of the bracket they start in.
  * In round-robin groups, a competitor's seed determines which group they are placed into.
  * In Swiss, a seed is the competitor's pairing number.
* Seeding, as a *verb*, is the act of sorting competitors from highest skill to lowest skill.
 Once this sorting has been performed, that seeding is then 'applied' to place competitors into their starting positions.

Seeding plays a crucial role for any competition because it determines the path each competitor must take.
'Accurate' seeding means that competitors are correctly sorted from highest skill to lowest skill, and should result in a fair competition.
'Bad' seeding would mean that competitors are not sorted correctly, and can lead to painful situations.
These adjectives are subjective, but usually have elements of objective basis to them.
A well-seeded competition usually starts with uneven matchups skill-wise, and then over time will have closer and closer matches.

In each format guide, I will touch on how that format interacts with seeding.
Some formats are heavily reliant on accurate seeding, some formats are not, and
 some formats are actually well-suited to *determine* accurate seeding for subsequent stages.

## Bracketing Software/Tournament Tools

:::important

Could use a visual for a generic tournament tool and how it's a webpage offering you tools to use, and showing off your tournament's info/results

:::

Unless you're doing things by hand (or in a private spreadsheet), you'll probably be making use of some form of bracketing software.
Popular choices include:

* [Battlefy](https://battlefy.com)
* [Challonge](https://challonge.com)
* [smash.gg](https://smash.gg)
* [Toornament](https://toornament.com)

In general, these tools offer invaluable features such as:

* A webpage for your tournament's information, bracketing, and results
* A way for competitors to register for your competition
* A means of seeding the competitors
* A means of generating brackets
  * For certain formats & event sizes, this is imperative because doing so by hand would be impractical
* A means of entering results & automatically progressing competitors to their next matches or stage

Each software/tool boasts its own strengths and weaknesses, and supports different formats in different ways.
Certain games communities have built their own software for their particular needs.
Picking the right tool for your project can save you a great deal of effort and prevent problems, so make sure to consider your options!
