This is a quick walkthrough of how I've formatted my format guides.

:::important

Could use visuals to generically communicate these sections' purposes. One is 'diagrams' (visual aids) another is 'numbers' (like calculating stuff) and the other is like 'notes'

## How it Works

First, I'll start by explaining how the format works, and will cover some important aspects & variations.

## By the Numbers

Next, I'll provide a reference table of important numbers for the format.
The values in these tables will include:

* \# of Matches Played
  * This is how many total matches will be played given *n* competitors.
  When you use groups, you should note that *n* is the number of competitors in a group (as opposed to overall number of competitors).
* \# of Necessary Rounds
  * The number of necessary, consecutive rounds of play given *n* competitors
  * This is how you can calculate the runtime of a format! Multiply # of necessary rounds by the time you expect a match to take
* Distinct Placements
  * These are the final standings you will have after you've completed all matches. If you want to award prizing, these will be your options.
* Possible progressions
  * How many competitors you could advance from the format. This may involve shortening the competition (e.g. stopping a single-elim bracket after quarterfinals so that you can advance 4 competitors)

:::note
The values in these tables assume that you are playing to completion and determining a 1st place.
If you are stopping early to advance competitors to another stage, then these values will be different.

## Notes for Different Roles

Here, I will list important notes for each role to keep in mind.
These might be opportunities to capitalize on an aspect of the format, potential issues to watch out for, or ways that different roles will need to communicate with each other.
When you're meeting with these roles and discussing your format options, these are some good starting points for conversation!

I might play around with putting the 'role' visuals here on the notes in each doc

### Competitors & Competitive Ops

Competitors & Competitive Ops overlap enough on format-related concerns that I've grouped them together here (not to mention, competitors are *usually not involved with planning events*).
Comp Ops, in an ideal world, exists to facilitate an excellent competitor experience while keeping everything running smoothly for broadcast & other stakeholders.
That being the case, Comp Ops' considerations are largely driven by how Competitors feel & behave in different formats.
The items I list for them in each format usually relate to the competitor experience and the logistics for operating that format.

### Broadcast

Broadcast tells the story of the competition to the world.
That being the case, Broadcast considerations are largely driven by what stories can be told and how they can be told.
The items I list for them relate to predictability in a format, typical storylines, and potential pitfalls.
This, implicitly, includes aspects of a format that *audiences* may find exciting (or boring).
