Hello there.

## How it Works

## By the Numbers

| Category              |      Value <br />(*n* is # of competitors)                |   Example / Notes |
| -------------         | :-----------:             | ----- |
| # of Matches Played*   | *2n - 2* or *2n -1*       | 16 competitors = 30 or 31 matches played <br />17 competitors = 32 or 33 matches played |
| # of Necessary Rounds* | *Floor[log₂(n-1)] + Ceiling[log₂(2n/3)] + 1* <br />[[1](#citations)] (or see below table!)          | 16 competitors = 8-9 required <br /> 17 competitors = 9-10 rounds required |
| Distinct Placements   |   1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 2x T-5th,<br />2x T-7th, 4x T-9th, 4x T-13th, etc.       |   |
| Possible progressions | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, etc.   |
