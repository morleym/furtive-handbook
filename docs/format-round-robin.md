Round Robin, Round-Robin, RR.
Next to single elimination, Round Robin may be the 'other' ubiqutous format
 (featured in most traditional sports).

## How it Works

"Everyone plays everyone else!"
I was tempted to stop writing after that, because it's amazingly easy to summarize as that.
Every competitor will play every other competitor once, meaning it's effectively one match per 'combination' of your competitors.
After all matches are completed, you will have a standings sorted by how the competitors performed.
The first sort is usually # of matches won.
The secondary/tertiary/etc. sorts are called 'tiebreakers' and usually consist of the following (adjusted to taste):

* Head-to-head record
* Game Differential (games won minus games lost) or Game Win % (percentage of games won out of total games played)
* [*Insert videogame-specific stat*] e.g. 'goal differential'

Occasionally, certain games/sports will boil all performance down to 'points' and will use those points for their round-robin standings instead of strictly # of matches won.
This is uncommon outside of games/sports where 'ties' are possible (e.g. FIFA), and consequently a match win/loss/tie will award different points.

Round Robins are visually distinct from 'brackets.' They may be shown as a table crossing the list of competitors with itself.
This way, you can easily see all matches for each competitor.

Often times (and especially for larger Round Robins) you may simply see a list of standings in lieu of an actual diagram of the matches (as this is easier to digest on a broadcast).

## By the Numbers

| Category              |      Value <br />(*n* is # of competitors)                |   Example / Notes |
| -------------         | :-----------:             | ----- |
| # of Matches Played   | *n! / [2! \* (n-2)!]*       | 8 competitors = 28 matches played <br />17 competitors = 136 matches played |
| # of Necessary Rounds | *n-1* (if *n* is even) <br />*n* (if *n* is odd)          | 8 competitors = 7 rounds required <br /> 17 competitors = 17 rounds required |
| Distinct Placements   |   All placements <br /> (1st - *n*<sup>th</sup>)       |   |
| Possible progressions | 1 to *n*  |
