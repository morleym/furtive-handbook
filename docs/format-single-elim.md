The *vanilla* ice cream of brackets.
It's simple, and pairs well with other ~~desserts~~ formats.

## How it Works

Competitors are seeded into rounds of matches.
Win, and you advance to the next round.
Lose, and you are eliminated.
This continues until only one competitor remains.
These rounds are typically named "Round of X" (e.g. Round of 64, Round of 32) to indicate how many competitors
 remain, or otherwise are referred to as "Round 1," "Round 2," etc.
Once you have 8 remaining competitors, rounds are then named "Quarterfinal" (8), "Semifinal" (4), and "Final" (2).
Optionally, you can add a 'third place match' where the losers of the semifinal matches play for third place.

## By the Numbers

| Category              |      Value <br />(*N* is # of competitors)                |   Example / Notes |
| -------------         | :-----------:             | ----- |
| # of Matches Played   | *N - 1*                   | 16 competitors = 15 matches played <br />17 competitors = 16 matches played |
| # of Necessary Rounds    |   logâ‚‚(*N*)               | 16 competitors = 4 rounds required <br /> 17 competitors = 5 rounds required |
| Distinct Placements   |   1st & 2nd, 3rd* & 4th, 4x T-5th,<br />8x T-9th, 16x T-17th, etc.       |   |
| Possible progressions | 1, 2, 3*, 4, 8, 16, etc.   |

**Only when a third place match is played.*

## Considerations for Competitors & Competitive Ops

* Competitors are only guaranteed one match (lowest of all format types)
  * Half of all competitors will only get to play one match
* Single-elimination depends on excellent seeding
  * If there are significant unknowns or 'mistakes' in seeding, then better competitors may be knocked out earlier than intended
* Competitors can chart out their course through bracket (to prepare for predicted matchups)

## Considerations for Broadcast

* It's easy to chart out the 'predicted' matchups throughout the day
  * Higher seeds will generally beat lower seeds. You can follow top seeds as a default story
  * Disruptions to this, aka 'upsets', are good stories themselves
* Every match is impactful
  * The winner moves on, and the loser goes home
* Flexible length of day. You can pick one match per round to broadcast, or you can 'hold up' matches to broadcast multiple/all per round
* Key competitors going home 'early' can negatively impact broadcast
