Every format needs **inputs** (what goes into the competition) and **outputs** (what comes out of the competition).
You will be taking these inputs & outputs, and assessing which formats are suitable.

An input is something like, "I expect 32 teams to sign up" or "I have eight setups for players to use"

## Example 1

**Inputs:**

* "I'm running an open 1v1 tournament in my garage next Saturday.
 Five people have signed up so far, but we might get like sixteen by the day of."
* "I have eight televisions and eight consoles"
* "I have to finish this all in six hours"
* "I'm not streaming any of it"

**Output(s):**

* "I just need a winner, and that's it"

There are some pretty easy takeaways from this!
No broadcast greatly simplifies things.

## Example 2

**Inputs:**

* "We're inviting six pro players, and we also want a couple open spots that anyone can qualify for."
* damn, writing this shit is difficult

:::important
*If your format has multiple parts, then you'll need to consider **the inputs & outputs for each of those parts** in addition to the inputs & outputs for the overall format.
