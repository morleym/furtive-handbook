Every format needs **inputs** (what goes into the competition) and **outputs** (what comes out of the competition).

## Examples of Inputs

* "I'm running an open 1v1 tournament in my garage next Saturday.
 Five people have signed up so far, but we might get like sixteen by the day of."
* "We're inviting eight of the best teams in North America, and that's it."
* "We're inviting six pro players, *but we also want a couple open spots that anyone can qualify for."

## Examples of Outputs

* "I need sixteen teams to advance from this qualifier bracket to make it into league play."
* "I just need a winner at the end of this."
* "I want a leaderboard."

*If your format has multiple parts, then you'll need to consider **the inputs & outputs for each of those parts** in addition to the inputs & outputs for the overall format.

## What to do With Them

You will be taking these inputs & outputs, and assessing which formats are suitable.
