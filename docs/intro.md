## What is this?

This is a reference guide for common competitive formats used in esports events!

To me, the creative freedom in formatting a competition is one of best parts of working in esports.
It's an impactful piece of any project, and it shouldn't be decided on as an afterthought.
Your format choices play a crucial role in delivering fair, fun and exciting experiences for your competitors, viewers, staff, and sponsors.
They can also make bad experiences, if you aren't careful!

Having a handy reference guide to compare format options will empower you to **lead productive conversations with your team** and **navigate unclear & tough decisions**.
You can steer them to take advantage of the opportunities a format provides and smoothly handle its challenges.

## Okay but *why* did you make this?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 [Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/4/d/highres_444404365.jpeg).
Today, I work on competitive operations and creative production for professional esports events like the [RLCS](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/introducing-rlcs-x/), [eMLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/emls-cup-2021-preview-how-watch-stream-and-follow-action),
 and [all kinds of projects in between](https://mitchellmorley.com).

While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a large amount of experience and learnings to draw from.
One of those learnings is that a team is *most* effective when its decision-makers understand the impact of their decisions on each role.
To that end, **I created this handbook to teach others how competitive format choices impact different roles on an esports project.**

I want to see the baseline of esports events rise to a higher quality, and that's only possible if we share knowledge openly.
Otherwise, people will continue to trip up on preventable logistical issues, or miss easy opportunities for storytelling, because they just weren't fully aware of how their competitive format worked.
It is my hope that you may walk gracefully today where I (and countless others) once tripped and fell.
