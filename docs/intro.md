## What is this?

This is a reference guide for common competitive formats used in esports events!

To me, the creative freedom in formatting a competition is one of best parts of working in esports.
It's an impactful piece of any project, and it shouldn't be decided on as an afterthought.
Your format choices play a crucial role in delivering fair, fun and exciting experiences for your competitors, broadcast, viewers, staff, sponsors and partners.
They can also make bad experiences, if you aren't careful!

Having a handy reference guide to compare format options will empower you to lead productive conversations with your teammates and navigate those tough decisions.
You can guide them to take advantage of the opportunities each format affords, and prepare them to smoothly handle potential issues.

## Who am I?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 [Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/4/d/highres_444404365.jpeg).
Today, I work on competitive operations and creative production for professional esports events like [RLCSX](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/introducing-rlcs-x/), [eMLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/emls-cup-2021-preview-how-watch-stream-and-follow-action),
 and all kinds of projects in between (which you can look at on [my portfolio](https://mitchellmorley.com)).

While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a fair amount of experience and learnings to draw from.
One of those learnings is that a team is *most* effective when its decision-makers understand the impact of decisions on each role. 
To that end, this handbook will teach you how competitive format choices impact different roles.
