Hi!
Welcome to my handbook.

## What is this?

This is a reference guide for a number of competitive formats used in esports events!
Different formats may be better or worse for YOUR needs, and this guide will shed light on that.

To me, the creative freedom of formatting an event is one of best parts of esports!
However, there's a difference between *consciously trying out ideas* (while being aware of potential benefits & pitfalls) and *winging it as an afterthought*.
Format choices can deliver fair, fun and exciting experiences—or awful ones—for your competitors, broadcast, viewers, staff, sponsors & partners.

Having a quick reference to compare the strengths and drawbacks of different formats will help you navigate those decisions.
Whether it's your first event or your hundredth, I hope this serves you well!

## Who am I?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 [Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/4/d/highres_444404365.jpeg).
Now I work on competitive operations for professional esports events like [RLCSX](https://www.mitchellmorley.com/work/rlcsx-winter-split) and [eMLS](https://www.mitchellmorley.com/work/emls-2021).
I've worked on all kinds of projects in-between, which you can look at on [my portfolio](https://mitchellmorley.com).
While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a fair amount of experience and learnings (read: failing and improving) to draw from.
