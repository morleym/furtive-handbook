## What is this?

This is a reference guide for common competitive formats used in esports events!

To me, the creative freedom in formatting a competition is one of best parts of working in esports.
It's an impactful piece of any project, and it shouldn't be decided on as an afterthought.
Your format choices will enable you to deliver fair, fun and exciting experiences for your competitors, broadcast, viewers, staff, sponsors and partnersâ€”or poor ones, if you aren't careful!
So when your team is meeting to figure out event details, you should be aware of potential benefits & pitfalls for each format.

**Having a reference to compare your format options will empower you to lead productive conversations with your team.**
With everyone prepared to make the most of a format in their roles, and to mitigate potential issues they'll encounter, you'll produce better results.

## Who am I?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 [Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/4/d/highres_444404365.jpeg).
Today, I work on competitive operations and creative production for professional esports events like [RLCSX](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/introducing-rlcs-x/), [eMLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/emls-cup-2021-preview-how-watch-stream-and-follow-action),
 and all kinds of projects in between (which you can look at on [my portfolio](https://mitchellmorley.com)).

While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a fair amount of experience, triumphs, and failures to draw from.
One of those learnings is that a team is most effective when decision-makers understand the impact of decisions on each role.
This handbook will help you learn how different format choices impact different roles.
