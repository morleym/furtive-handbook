Hi!
Welcome to my handbook.

## What is this?

This is a reference guide for common competitive formats used in esports events!

To me, the creative freedom in formatting a competition is one of best parts of working in esports.
Your format choices will enable you to deliver fair, fun and exciting experiences for your competitors, broadcast, viewers, staff, sponsors and partnersâ€”or poor ones, if you aren't careful!
Consequently, it's important that you are *consciously working with your format ideas*, while being aware of potential benefits & pitfalls, rather than *winging it as an afterthought*.

Having a quick reference to compare the strengths and drawbacks of different formats will empower you to lead productive conversations with your team.
With everyone prepared to make the most of a format in their roles, and to mitigate potential issues they'll encounter, your team will produce better results.

## Who am I?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 [Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage](https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/d/4/d/highres_444404365.jpeg).
Today, I work on competitive operations and creative production for professional esports events like [RLCSX](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/introducing-rlcs-x/), [eMLS](https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/emls-cup-2021-preview-how-watch-stream-and-follow-action),
 and all kinds of projects in-between (which you can look at on [my portfolio](https://mitchellmorley.com)).

While the bulk of my work has been in competitive operations (formatting events, authoring rulesets, configuring tournament pages & registration, managing communications with teams & players, executing gameday matches, etc.), I have also been the creative producer for several shows and the project manager for others.
While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a fair amount of experience, triumphs, and failures to draw from.
One of the most important learnings I carry is this: an idea is only 'great' if you can sell someone else on it.
To do that, you need to see where they're coming from (considering their role in the project) and appeal directly to them with empathy.
