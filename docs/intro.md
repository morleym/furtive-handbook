## What is this?

This is a brief reference guide for the common competitive formats used in esports events!
It will cover how each format works (with numbers to crunch for scheduling & logistics) and items that different project roles should be aware of.

## Okay but *why* did you make this?

I created this handbook to shed light on how competitive format choices impact different roles on an esports project.
Your competition's format is impactful, and it shouldn't be decided on as an afterthought.
Your format choices play a crucial role in delivering fair, fun and exciting experiences for your competitors, viewers, staff, and sponsors.
They can also create bad experiences, if you aren't careful!

While I would never claim to be the authority on competitive formatting, I have a serviceable collection of experiences and learnings to draw from.
One of those learnings is that a team is most effective when its decision-makers understand the impact of their decisions on the various roles who are delivering the 'product' of the competition.

I want to see the baseline of esports events rise to a higher quality, and that's only possible if we share knowledge openly.
Otherwise, people will continue to trip up on preventable logistical issues, or miss easy opportunities for storytelling, on account of missing some information on their competitive format.

## How might this help me?

Having a handy reference guide to compare format options will empower you to **lead productive conversations with your team** and **navigate unclear & tough decisions**.
You can steer them to take advantage of the opportunities a format provides *and* to smoothly handle its drawbacks or challenges.
It is my hope that you may walk gracefully today where I (and countless others) have tripped and stumbled.

## Who made all of the cool visuals?

My good friend Jordan "Boomstick" Davis created the visuals on this project.
He's awesome, and you should go check out his [turn-key production services](https://www.hitscanstudios.com/)!

## Who are you?

My name is Mitchell Morley, and I also go by 'furtive'.
I've been working on esports events since 2015, when I started running
 Rocket League LAN tournaments out of a friend's garage.

Since then, I've worked on competitive operations and creative production for professional esports leagues & events like the Rocket League Championship Series, eMLS,
 and [all kinds of projects in between](https://mitchellmorley.com).
