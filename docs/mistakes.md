My hope is that you don't find yourself in a sticky situation.
Not every sticky situation is the result of an explicit mistake.

## Runtime/Enjoyment

Usually, issues in this category occur either due to:

- thoughtlessness in choosing the format
- a misunderstanding of setup constraints

## Integrity/Trust

Usually, issues in this category occur either due to:

- a lack of foresight in authoring rules
- the competition particular format with an implementation involving a tournament software (or lack thereof)
