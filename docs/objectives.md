title: Objectives & Approach

Whether you're starting from square one, or working for a prestigious company,
 you have to approach each project with objectives in mind.
You'll usually have to parse 'objectives' from conversations with each stakeholder who's involved in your event.
If you're running an event entirely by yourself, then I guess you can have some Gollum & Smeagol fun.

Parties involved with an event might be:

* Competitors (the players/teams themselves)
* Competitive Operations (tournament admins)
* Competitor Orgs (organizations that competitors represent)
* Broadcast (production team, talent, etc.)
* Sponsors/Partners

What each stakeholder *wants* may align or conflict with one another.
The classic example to dive into is between competitive ops (who generally focus on competitor experience)
 and broadcast (who are most focused on storytelling).
Let's consider a single-elimination bracket with 8 competitors:

* In the world without a broadcast, you will run every match when it's ready (no waiting for competitors).
* In the world where the broadcast is everything, you might run *every* match on broadcast (so that you don't miss any action)
