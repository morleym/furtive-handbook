title: Objectives & Approach

Whether you're starting from square one, or working for a prestigious company,
 you have to approach each project with objectives in mind.
By and large, those objectives come from your project's stakeholders.

## Stakeholders

Typical stakeholders involved with an event might be:

* **Competitors** (the players/teams themselves)
* **Competitive Operations** (tournament admins)
* **Broadcast** (production team, talent, etc.)
* Competitor Orgs (brands that competitors represent)
* Sponsors/Partners

I'll be focusing on the **bolded** stakeholders in this handbook,
 because (in my opinion) these are the core of an esports product.
Additionally, I will be grouping **Competitors** and **Competitive Ops** together.

## Conflicting Interests

What each stakeholder *wants* may align or conflict with one another.
The classic example to dive into is between competitive ops (who are most focused on competitor experience & keeping the competition flowing smoothly)
 and broadcast (who are most focused on teling the story of the competition to the world).
Let's consider a single-elimination bracket with 8 competitors:

* In the world without a broadcast, you probably want to run every match when it's ready (smoothest, quickest execution).
* In the world where the broadcast is everything, you probably want to run every match on broadcast (so that you don't miss any action)

Obviously, these are at odds!
*"Running every match when it's ready"* means you would only catch one quarterfinal and one semifinal on a broadcast.
*"Running every match on broadcast"* means players would wait longer between matches (if you play in the first quarterfinal,
 then you'd need to wait for three other matches to finish before you could play again).

So you have to come up with solutions, and discuss with each party.
Maybe you propose that *two* quarterfinal matches will be streamed.
Competitive ops says "Sure, that means players will only have to wait up to *two* matches' time."
Broadcast says, "Okay! That means we'll only miss two matches (and they're the earliest round)."
Great job, team!

The larger a project is—and the more stakeholders it has—the more difficult this balancing act becomes.
But the principle remains the same: **gather what each party wants**, **learn why they want it**, and **determine where to compromise and appeal to their wants**.

For that last part, you'll need to quickly and confidently speak to how different formats suit (or don't suit) different goals.
For example, round-robin has an entirely predetermined set of matches you can re-arrange while Swiss has you flying blind, hour by hour.
Round-robin scales linearly with competitors while Swiss scales logarithmically.

This handbook will try to appeal to the general wants of different stakeholders for each format, but your exact needs may differ.
Use this as a jumping-off point, and work towards the best solutions for your project.
