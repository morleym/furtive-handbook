Maybe you're working solo on your first-ever project.
Maybe you're the head of Competitive Ops for a franchised esports league.
Maybe you're the producer for a grassroots event broadcast.
No matter what role you're playing, or what size & shape your project is,
 you will need to work closely with your fellow **stakeholders**: **the people who have a stake in your project**.
They are invested in the event's outcome because they are involved with, working on, or otherwise supporting the project.
(If you're running a project by yourself, then consider these to be each of the different hats you're wearing!)

Typical stakeholders involved with an event are:

* **Competitors** (the players/teams competing)
* **Competitive Operations** aka "Comp Ops" (tournament admins/referees)
* **Broadcast** (production team, talent, etc.)
* Competitor Orgs (brands that competitors represent)
* The Competition's brand/Organizer's brand (social media/marketing/PR)
* Event Sponsors & Partners
* "The Client" (when you are white-labeling an event)

This is not an exhaustive list.
Some projects have a dedicated hospitality team, a partnerships team, or other important stakeholders.
For the sake of keeping a tight scope in this handbook, I'll be focusing on the **bolded** three in this handbook
 because (in my opinion) these are the core of an esports product.
Additionally, I will be grouping Competitors and Competitive Ops together.

## Being a Leader

What different stakeholders like and dislike about different formats may align or conflict with one another.
And that's a good thing!
Every role is trying to make a certain aspect of the event the best it can be.
At the end of the day it is ONE team, ONE project, and your team will have to come up with a solution.
Who will help the team craft good format options, rally everyone behind the final decision, and prepare them to make the most of it in their roles?
**Here's where you come in.**

Even if you aren't a leader on paper (in a position to call the shots), you can still be a leader in service!
Your team *will* benefit from you knowing how different competitive formats impact your role and your teammates' roles.
You can speak up confidently in meetings to guide conversations in a productive direction, you can privately share helpful information to prop up your teammates and set them up for success, and you can generally be a positive force for your project.

These format guides, once you familiarize yourself, will prepare you to tackle all kinds of format comparisons with your team.
What would Competitors, Competitive Ops, and Broadcast each think of Swiss versus Round Robin? For each format...

* Which aspects could they take advantage of in their roles?
* Which aspects would present challenges for their roles?
* Where would different stakeholders need to coordinate with each other, and how?

Before we jump into the specific formats to answer these questions, we need to quickly cover a few important concepts that apply to all formats.
