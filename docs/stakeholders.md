Maybe you're working solo on your first-ever project.
Maybe you're the head of Comp Ops for a franchised esports league.
Maybe you're the producer for a grassroots event broadcast.
No matter what role you're playing, or what size & shape your project fits,
 you have to appease your stakeholders.
If you're running a project by yourself, then consider these to be each of the different hats you're wearing!

### Stakeholders

Typical stakeholders involved with an event are:

* **Competitors** (the players/teams themselves)
* **Competitive Operations** (tournament admins/referees)
* **Broadcast** (production team, talent, etc.)
* Competitor Orgs (brands that competitors represent)
* The Competition's/Organizer's brand (social media/marketing)
* Sponsors/Partners

I'll be focusing on the **bolded** stakeholders in this handbook,
 because (in my opinion) these are the core of an esports product.
Additionally, I will be grouping **Competitors** and **Competitive Ops** together.

## Conflicting Interests

What each stakeholder *wants* may align or conflict with one another.
A classic example to dive into is how Competitive Ops and Broadcast might approach scheduling.
Comp Ops is focused on competitor experience & keeping the competition flowing smoothly.
Broadcast is focused on telling the story of that competition to the world.
With that in mind, let's consider a single-elimination bracket with 8 competitors:

* In a world without a broadcast, you'd run every match when it's ready for the smoothest and quickest execution and the least waiting time for competitors.
* In a world where the broadcast is everything, you'd run every match on broadcast so that you don't miss any action

Obviously, these are at odds!
*"Running every match when it's ready"* means you would only catch one quarterfinal and one semifinal on a broadcast.
*"Running every match on broadcast"* means players would wait longer between matches because if you play in the first quarterfinal,
 then you'd need to wait for three other matches to finish before you could play again.

## Lead the Charge

To address this, you will have to develop potential solutions and appeal to each side.
Maybe you propose that only *one* quarterfinal match will be streamed, and then both semifinals and the finals.
You appeal to Competitive Ops by saying, "Sure, that means players will have some waiting, but only for winning the first semifinal!"
You then appeal to Broadcast with, "That means we'll miss matches in the *earliest* round, but we will catch all of the action beyond that."
Maybe they both end up liking the answer.
Maybe you have to adjust to broadcast *two* quarterfinal matches.
Eventually, in the end, you come to a solution that everyone gets behind and you move forward.

The larger a project is—and the more stakeholders it has—the more difficult this balancing act becomes.
But the principle remains the same: **gather what each party wants**, **learn why they want it**, and **determine where to compromise and appeal to their wants**.

For that last part, you'll need to quickly and confidently speak to how different formats suit (or don't suit) different goals.
For example, round-robin has an entirely predetermined set of matches you can re-arrange while Swiss has you flying blind, hour by hour.
Round-robin scales linearly with competitors while Swiss scales logarithmically.
What would Comp Ops think of each?
What would Broadcast think of each?

This handbook will provide you with general considerations for each stakeholder, but your exact needs may differ.
Use this as a jumping-off point, and work towards the best solutions for your project.
And even if you aren't in a position to make the calls on your project, you can still benefit from seeing how different formats can impact your role.
