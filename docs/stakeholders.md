Maybe you're working solo on your first-ever project.
Maybe you're the head of Competitive Ops for a franchised esports league.
Maybe you're the producer for a grassroots event broadcast.
No matter what role you're playing, or what size & shape your project is,
 you will need to work with your fellow stakeholders.
If you're running a project by yourself, then consider these to be each of the different hats you're wearing!

### Stakeholders

Typical stakeholders involved with an event are:

* **Competitors** (the players/teams themselves)
* **Competitive Operations** (tournament admins/referees)
* **Broadcast** (production team, talent, etc.)
* Competitor Orgs (brands that competitors represent)
* The Competition's/Organizer's brand (social media/marketing)
* Sponsors/Partners

This, of course, is not an exhaustive list.
Some companies have a dedicated hospitality team, another might have a partnerships manager, etc. and they will require consideration for those projects.
For the sake of keeping a tight scope in this handbook, I'll be focusing on the **bolded** stakeholders in this handbook
 because (in my opinion) these are the core of an esports product.
Additionally, I will be grouping **Competitors** and **Competitive Ops** together.

## Conflicting Interests

What each stakeholder *wants* may align or conflict with one another.
A classic example to dive into is how Competitive Ops and Broadcast might approach scheduling.
Competitive Ops is focused on competitor experience & keeping the competition flowing smoothly.
Broadcast is focused on telling the story of that competition to the world.
With that in mind, let's consider a single-elimination bracket with 8 competitors:

* In the "CompOps is everything" universe, Competitive Ops would want to run every match when it's ready (because that is the quickest execution with the least waiting time for competitors).
* In the "Broadcast is everything" universe, Broadcast would want every match to be captured (because that would tell the full story of the competition).

Obviously, these are at odds!
Running every match when it's ready means that the broadcast would miss half of the matches played.
Capturing every match on broadcast means some competitors would wait far longer between matches.

## Lead the Charge

To address a conflict like this, you need to develop potential solutions and appeal to each side.
Maybe you propose that only *one* quarterfinal match will be streamed, and then both semifinals and the finals.
You appeal to Competitive Ops by saying, "This way, only one competitor (winner of the first semifinal) will have downtime!"
You then appeal to Broadcast with, "That means we'll miss a few matches in the *earliest* round, but we will catch *all* of the action after that."
Maybe they both end up liking the answer.
Maybe you have to adjust to broadcast *two* quarterfinal matches.
Eventually, in the end, you come to a solution that everyone gets behind and you move forward.

The larger a project is—and the more stakeholders it has—the more difficult this balancing act becomes.
But the principle remains the same: **gather what each party wants**, **learn why they want it**, and **determine where to compromise and appeal to their wants**.

For that last part, you'll need to quickly and confidently speak to how different formats suit (or don't suit) different wants.
For example, round-robin has an entirely predetermined set of matches you can re-arrange while Swiss has you flying blind, hour by hour.
Round-robin scales linearly with competitors while Swiss scales logarithmically.
What would Competitive Ops think of each?
What would Broadcast think of each?

This handbook will provide you with general considerations for each stakeholder, but your exact needs may differ.
Use this as a jumping-off point, and work towards the best solutions for your project.
And even if you aren't in a position to make the calls on your project, you will still benefit from knowing how different formats can impact *your* role and your *teammates'* roles.
