description: Some additional, soapboxing thoughts of a battle-scarred esports contractor
---

:::caution
This page is HIGHLY opinionated and contains swearing
:::

My primary goal for this handbook was to establish some foundations for competitive formatting and to tie those into
  the different project roles of esports products.
But, beyond that, I'm hoping to share my way of thinking: challenging yourself to make the best damn esports products you can, carving your own path, exploring your own frontier, etc. etc.

Your projects & products will have their own, unique needs.
Needs which may sometimes conflict with the general foundations laid out here.
And that is okay!
As I stated in the introduction, I am not the authority on these matters.
In fact...

## No One is the Authority*

\**steps on soapbox*\*

Esports is a frontier.
Even though we have (arguably) decades of history now, we're still getting onto our feet as an industry.
There are heroes and success stories, sure.
But the overwhelming majority of esports efforts are still low-to-zero budget events & shows powered by passion.
Personally, I think that's less of an endearing characteristic of esports and more of a shameful burden.
We should be doing better.

Those with resources and momentum ought to be generating financially stable paths in the industry.
Instead, they are often the ones perpetuating underpaid/unpaid internships and entry-level work.
The excuse about "well we aren't exactly making money" doesn't make it *okay* do so.
For the leaders of these entities to simultaneously believe in their company, while not paying people and/or paying them poorly, makes me question what exactly their metric of success is.
Wouldn't true success include leaving your mark in a *good* way?
Positively shaping the industry to be better than you found it?

So when such people claim to be an authority (in one way or another), and they aren't directly helping uplift others,
  I don't tend to trust that any advice they give is:

  a) Competent  
  or  
  b) With anyone else's best interests in mind

(Same goes if someone seems to primarily be aiming for profit on 'helping others'.
Looking at you, Esports Certification Institute)

And that thought brings me to an important warning for the new folks hopping into the industry: **just because someone made it to a prominent position in a popular company does not mean they are a role model!!**
They could be, but you shouldn't assume that.
Have healthy skepticism when anyone tells you how things *should* work, passing things off as 'the' way as opposed to 'their' way, or telling you how you *should* become successful.
They may be well-intentioned, and sometimes they *also* may not be very good at their job (which is *crazy*, but it happens all the time).

To that end, I tried to ensure that anything outside of empirical info was presented as my personal opinion, in this handbook.
And that's also why I didn't title this thing "the" handbookâ€”it's *my* handbook.
And that healthy skepticism I asked you to hold?
It sure as shit should apply to me, too.
After all, the fact that you don't even see a company title in *my* Twitter bio doesn't exactly bolster my credibility (even if you are aware of the world of freelance gigs powering esports today).
So you'd better challenge what I've shared with you throughout this handbook, look for mistakes, and be prepared to override whatever I recommend.

\**steps off soapbox*\*

It's nigh impossible to cover all of the potential uses for different formats and their variants in the world of esports products.
My hope is that if you ever encounter a situation where you need to make a strange judgment call on competitive formats,
  then you're at least prepared to think through it from a few different angles (to defend your decision and make the best of it).

You should feel chained neither to novelty nor tradition.
Use whatever you can learn from those shiny checkmarks on Twitter, dingy resources like this one, and your own experiences, to **define your own meaning of excellence**.
On that subject, **you* are the only authority in the world.

## Make Something to be Proud Of

If you're just starting out, then just completing an event might be your bar for success.
But if you've been at this for a while, then I challenge you: don't be satisfied unless you're striving for *better*.
Communicate more clearly & concisely with participants.
Find ways to improve your pre-production pipeline with your teammates.
Brainstorm ideas for cooler stories to tell, and how you can format a competition & establish processes to set the stage for those stories.
Or, find ways to take your existing & solid competition format and tell a better story with it on broadcast.

In short, don't be complacent.
Go Beyond.
GLHF out there!
