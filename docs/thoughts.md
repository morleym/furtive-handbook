The primary goal of this handbook was to establish some foundations for competitive formatting and tying those into
  the different project roles of esports products.
But beyond that, I am hoping to instill a way of thinking: challenging yourself to make the best damn esports products you can.
Carving your own path.
Exploring your own frontier.
Your journey, your projects & products, and your teammates will have their own, unique needs.
Needs which may conflict with and supersede the foundations laid out here.

And that is okay!
As I stated in the introduction, I am not the authority on these matters.
In fact...

## No One is the Authority

Esports is a frontier.
Even though we have (arguably) decades of history now, we're still getting onto our feet as an industry.
There are heroes and success stories, sure.
But the overwhelming majority of esports efforts are still low-to-zero budget events powered by passion.
Personally, I think that's less of an endearing characteristic of esports and more of a shameful burden.

So when people claim to be the authority (in one way or another), but they aren't directly helping uplift others,
  I don't tend to trust them.
(Or if they're trying to make a buck on helping others. Looking at you, Esports Certification Institute)!
**Just because someone made it to a prominent position in a popular company does not mean they are a role model.**
Be critical of anyone telling you how things *should* work.
I tried to ensure that anything outside of empirical info was presented as my personal opinion, in this handbook.
