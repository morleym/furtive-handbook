description: Some additional, soapboxing thoughts of a battle-scarred esports contractor
---

The primary goal of this handbook was to establish some foundations for competitive formatting and to tie those into
  the different project roles of esports products.
But, beyond that, I'm hoping to instill a way of thinking: challenging yourself to make the best damn esports products you can.
Carving your own path.
Exploring your own frontier.

Your projects & products will have their own, unique needs.
Needs which may sometimes conflict with the general foundations laid out here.
And that is okay!
As I stated in the introduction, I am not the authority on these matters.
In fact...

## No One is the Authority*

\**steps on soapbox*\*

Esports is a frontier.
Even though we have (arguably) decades of history now, we're still getting onto our feet as an industry.
There are heroes and success stories, sure.
But the overwhelming majority of esports efforts are still low-to-zero budget events powered by passion.
Personally, I think that's less of an endearing characteristic of esports and more of a shameful burden.

So when people claim to be the authority (in one way or another), but they aren't directly helping uplift others,
  I don't tend to trust them.
(Or if they're trying to make a buck on 'helping others'.
Looking at you, Esports Certification Institute!)
**Just because someone made it to a prominent position in a popular company does not mean they are a role model!!**
Be critical of anyone telling you how things *should* work, passing things off as 'the' way as opposed to 'their' way, or telling you how you *should* become successful.
To that end, I tried to ensure that anything outside of empirical info was presented as my personal opinion, in this handbook.
And, I didn't title this thing "the" handbookâ€”it's *my* handbook.

\**steps off soapbox*\*

It's nigh impossible to cover all of the potential uses for different formats and their variations in the world of esports products.
My hope is that if you ever encounter a situation where you need to make a strange judgment call on competitive formats,
  then you're at least prepared to think through it from a few different angles (to defend your decision and make the best of it).

You should feel chained neither to novelty nor tradition.
Use whatever you can learn from resources like this one, and your own experiences, to define your own meaning of excellence.
On that subject, **you* are the only authority in the world.

## Make Something to be Proud Of

If you're just starting out, then just completing an event might be your bar for success.
But if you've been at this for a while, then I challenge you: don't be satisfied unless you're striving for *better*.
Communicate more clearly & concisely with participants.
Find ways to improve your pre-production pipeline with your teammates.
Brainstorm ideas for cooler stories to tell, and how you can format a competition to set the stage.
Or, find ways to take your existing & solid competition format and tell a better story with it on broadcast.

In short, don't be complacent.
Go Beyond.
GLHF out there!
