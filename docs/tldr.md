Was that too meaty?
Fine.
Here are some simplified recommendations, incorporating the considerations listed throughout the format guides.

These are not laws! Just basic advice.

## Common Topics

### Non-eliminating or eliminating format?

Use **only a non-eliminating format** (Round-Robin/Swiss) if:

* You are doing a social event
* You want to guarantee the most matches for all competitors
* You have adequate time & setups to run it

Use **only an eliminating format** (Single/Double-Elim) if:

* You are running a more competitive event
* You have minimal time & setups to run it

Use **both** if:

* You have adequate time & setups to run it
* You want to guarantee multiple matches *and* deliver an exciting finish

### Single-Elim or Double-Elim?

Use **Single-Elimination** if:

* You are more constrained by time & setups
* You are less concerned with guaranteeing matches for competitors
  * For example, maybe your tournament started with Round-Robin or Double-Elimination groups, so they've already played multiple matches

Use **Double-Elimination** if:

* You are less constrained by time & setups
* You are more concerned with guaranteeing matches for competitors
  * If your whole tournament consists of just one bracket, then you probably should make sure competitors get more than one match
* You want the "losers run" storyline

### Round-Robin or Swiss?

Use **Round-Robin** if:

* You have few competitors, or you can break things into smaller groups easily
* You are less constrained by time
* You are more concerned with knowing matchups in advance

Use **Swiss** if:

* You have many competitors, or cannot easily break things into smaller groups
* You are more constrained by time
* You are less concerned with knowing the matchups in advance
* You have adequate software/tooling/staff to process Swiss pairings, scoring, and tiebreakers
